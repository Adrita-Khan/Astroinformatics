# Pulsar Detection in Astronomy with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)

Often in astronomy, signals are detected in the presence of noise. The following example addresses the question: **How many pulsars are detected in images taken with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) telescope?** The MWA is a low-frequency radio telescope located in Western Australia. It detects radio emissions at frequencies between 80 and 300 megahertz, comparable to those of popular radio stations. The telescope has a very large field of view, making it ideal for large survey projects. A typical image from the MWA is shown. The grayscale represents the flux density of emission from astronomical objects, with black indicating high flux density and gray representing background noise. Most black dots in such images are distant radio galaxies; however, some are objects within our galaxy, such as pulsars or supernova remnants.

In radio astronomy, **flux density** is measured in units of Janskys, equivalent to \(10^{-26}\) watts per square meter per hertz. Flux density measures the spectral power received by a telescope detector per unit projected area. Detailed information is available in the provided resources. For this exercise, it is sufficient to understand that the apparent brightness of a pulsar at a given frequency is being measured. Astronomical objects are significantly fainter compared to terrestrial sources like mobile phones.

Astronomy images are typically stored in the **FITS file format**. They can be viewed using software such as DS9 or online tools like Aladin. Some images are displayed in false color; however, radio frequencies do not possess color. These color maps are employed solely to accentuate different aspects of the intensity scale.

Displayed are small cutouts from large radio images. The image on the left shows a pulsar detection at the center, while the image on the right shows no detection. A detection is typically defined as a flux density more than five standard deviations above the local noise. When searching for radio emissions at MWA frequencies at the locations of all known pulsars, detections occur occasionally but are generally infrequent. Non-detections may result from various factors, such as the pulsar being too distant, intrinsic emission not being strong at these frequencies, or the emission being intermittent.

While non-detections might seem uninformative, astronomers have developed techniques to extract information from them. One such technique is **stacking**, which measures the statistical properties of an undetectable population. Stacking is effective because noise in radio images is roughly random and follows a Gaussian distribution centered on zero. When regions containing only noise are added, the random numbers cancel out. Conversely, when regions containing signals are added, the signals accumulate, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio.

This concept can be demonstrated with one-dimensional signals. Consider a signal resembling a single Gaussian with added random noise. With sufficient noise, the signal becomes obscured. However, averaging 100 such signals with random noise reveals an increased signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the underlying signal to be detected across the entire population of 100 sources.

Applying this to pulsar detection presents a challenge: undetected pulsars are dispersed across the sky. To stack them, their positions must first be aligned to the same pixel. The stacking process involves calculating the mean stack by averaging every pixel in the image to form a new image. This procedure is outlined in the subsequent activities.

During a student project, the process was initially straightforward until a suggestion to perform a **median stack** introduced complexity. The median is considered a more robust statistic than the mean because it is less sensitive to outliers. In symmetric distributions, the mean and median yield the same result; however, in asymmetric distributions or those with significant outliers, the median better represents the central value. This topic will be explored further in the next lecture, highlighting how a simple methodological change can significantly impact computational ease.
