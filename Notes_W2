# **Week 2 Notes**

### 1. **Emission of Radiation by Astronomical Objects**  
- Every type of astronomical object emits radiation at unique frequencies.

### 2. **Role of Telescopes in Astronomy**  
- Astronomers use telescopes and various optical devices to detect and analyze these frequencies across different scales.  

### 3. **Radio Emission in Astronomy**  
- Radio waves (centimeter to meter wavelengths) are emitted when electrons are accelerated in magnetic fields.  
- These emissions often indicate massive shocks occurring in space.  

### 4. **Example: Optical and Radio Observation**  
- Combining optical and radio data reveals fascinating insights, such as **Hercules A**:  
  - A **radio galaxy** located **643 megaparsecs (2.1 billion light-years)** away—considered a nearby galaxy in cosmological terms.  
  - Observations reveal:  
    - The **galactic core**, where a supermassive black hole resides.  
    - **Jets of energy** extending to the galaxy’s outskirts and beyond.  
    - **Massive lobes** of older radio emissions from past activity cycles.  
  - In optical imaging, the elliptical galaxy (**3C348**) appears as a collection of stars.

### 5. **Human Vision Limitations**  
- Our eyes can only detect light in the **visible spectrum** of the electromagnetic spectrum.  

### 6. **Structure and Impact of Galaxies**  
- **Galaxies** are composed of:  
  - Stars, gas, dust, and a **supermassive black hole** at their center.  
  - These black holes are millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun but occupy a space smaller than our solar system.  
- **Supermassive Black Holes** significantly influence galaxy growth and formation:  
  - When large amounts of gas are present near the galaxy's center, it forms an **accretion disk**, releasing immense energy.  
  - This process leads to an **Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)**:  
    - AGNs are so bright they can outshine the entire galaxy.  
    - They generate more energy than all the galaxy's stars combined.  
  - The accretion process also creates:  
    - **Magnetic field-driven jets** extending far beyond the galaxy, sometimes spanning **millions of light-years**.  
    - Radio emissions from high-speed electrons spiraling around these magnetic fields, revealing the black hole's past activity.  

### 7. **Performance of Data Processing**  
- Cross-matching data across large catalogues demonstrates the relationship between data size and processing time:  
  - For 100 galaxies: ~50 milliseconds.  
  - For 1,000 galaxies: ~5,000 milliseconds.  
  - For 10,000 galaxies: ~500,000 milliseconds.  
- **Observation**: Doubling the dataset increases processing time exponentially.
